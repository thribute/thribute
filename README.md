# Thribute Stores

**Thribute Stores** is a multi-vendor e-commerce platform built to empower small and local sellers by helping them take their businesses online with minimal charges. Our goal is to make digital commerce accessible and affordable for everyone, especially those who are currently underserved by high-fee platforms.

### About the Project

This platform allows individual sellers and small businesses to create and manage their own online stores with ease. We aim to remove the barriers that often prevent small sellers from entering the online market by offering a low-cost, easy-to-use solution.

We believe that everyone deserves a chance to grow in the digital economy, and **Thribute Stores** is our step toward making that a reality.

### Current Status

The platform is currently in the development phase and will be going live soon. We're working hard to deliver a smooth, secure, and scalable experience.  
Please stay tuned and check back in a few weeks for the launch!
